### Home Network Security with Raspberry Pi & Pi-hole

The project addresses the growing need for security and privacy in home networks. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi and the Pi-hole and Tailscale VPN technologies, our goal was to create a robust solution that blocks domains known to contain trackers, unwanted ads, and malicious sites, ensuring safe and private browsing.

#### Project Summary
**Title:** Home Network Security with Raspberry Pi & Pi-hole  
**Authors:** Caike Alexandrino, Jo√£o Vittor Domingos de Jesus  
**Institution:** Faculdades Einstein de Limeira  
**Advisor:** Jonas Henrique Ferreira

#### Objectives and Results
- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Raspberry Pi:** A versatile and affordable microcomputer, ideal for network security projects.
  - **Pi-hole:** An ad and tracker blocker that acts as a local DNS server, blocking malicious domains and improving privacy.
  - **Tailscale VPN:** A VPN that encrypts internet traffic, ensuring confidential data remains secure.

- Key Results:
  - **Efficient Blocking:** Pi-hole successfully blocked domains associated with malware, phishing, and malicious content.
  - **Increased Privacy:** The combination of Pi-hole with Tailscale VPN significantly reduced exposure to online threats and unwanted tracking.
  - **Challenges Overcome:** We overcame initial challenges in configuring and integrating the technologies, resulting in a reliable and effective solution.

#### Conclusion
The implementation of Raspberry Pi with Pi-hole and Tailscale VPN proved to be an effective solution for enhancing security and privacy in home networks.
